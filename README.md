## Hi there 👋👨‍💻 
I'm a software developer harnessing the world's power for its biggest problems.

I learned full-stack web development during my boot camp career, where we created web applications using React, Express, Node, and PostgreSQL.

As a child, I had many interests in gaming and I found myself growing eager to find out how I would be able to create a game myself. From then on, I found myself trailing this thing called programming. Through my educational career, I found a never-ending love for logical problems and of course, mathematics, which helped me fully decide on pursuing computer science. Now, I want to be able to put my skills to the test and satisfy my everlasting need to know more about how systems within the industry work and the small cogs and gears that make them work. In the future, I'd hope to teach everyone else my knowledge and help them within the path of becoming a developer themself.
